# Debris Image Recognition for Beach Cleanups

Marine debris is a persistent problem that is only becoming worse. Beach cleanups are no longer a viable long-term solution. Not only is it a threat to human beings, but marine debris has negatively impacted marine species to the point of inadvertent ingestion, entanglement, and death. 
We look to apply a machine learning image recognition algorithm using the fast.ai library for coastal cleanup applications, i.e. robotics and/or other autonomous machines.
